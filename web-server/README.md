# Web Server

We want our Python package to be able to
take data from several different sources
(e.g. local files, database, etc). One of these
sources should be a web server.

In this directory, we define a simple web
server to test our package's capacity to
communicate with web servers.

## Getting Started

Make sure to install Node.js and yarn.
If you have a Mac, Homebrew should make this
step very easy.

Install dependencies by changing the
working directory into this
directory and applying the command:
```bash
yarn install
```

To run the server, simply run:
```bash
./compile-and-run.sh
```
