    "\n",
    "The extreme changes (in the thousands) could also be due to missing values in the dataset. Many of our access points have missing data points, which means that a device connected to one building in the afternoon wasn't noticed until it moved to another building at night.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is distribution lowest around 13:30?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that 12:00 is not when we expect occupancy to be at its lowest. Classes generally range from 9:00 to 18:00, so 13:30 is a reasonable expectation for the distribution's dipping point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are changes from 1:30 to 13:30 more gradual than those from 13:30 to 1:30?\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be because there's greater variation in sleep time than variation in the time that students start studying at night.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is there much more variation in the upper quartile than other quartiles?\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be due to a fixed/stable number of devices which don't vary much throughout the day. These could be public devices (e.g. library computers) or staff devices (e.g. staff phones). It's worth noting that the minimum doesn't change much throughout the day."
